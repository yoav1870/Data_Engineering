## Overview
Welcome to Nail Salon ! 
End-to-end data engineering solution using Apache Iceberg, MinIO, Spark, Kafka, and Airflow. The pipeline covers batch and streaming data, with orchestration and data quality checks.

## Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yoav1870/Data_Engineering.git
   ```

2. **Start all components**

   - Processing (MinIO, Spark, Iceberg):
     ```bash
     cd processing
     docker-compose up -d --build
     ```
   - Streaming (Kafka, Producer, Consumer):
     ```bash
     cd ../streaming
     docker-compose up -d --build
     ```
   - Orchestration (Airflow):
     ```bash
     cd ../orchestration
     docker-compose up -d --build
     ```

3. **Access UIs**

   - MinIO: http://localhost:9001 (admin/password)
   - Airflow: http://localhost:8081 (admin/admin)

4. **Trigger pipelines**
   - Use Airflow UI to run ETL jobs and monitor progress.

## Email Notifications

- **To receive email notifications:**
  - Update the email addresses and SMTP password in both the Airflow DAG (ETL) and your local `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Documentation

- See `docs/` for architecture and data model diagrams (Mermaid.js).
- See `docs/checks.txt` for ready-to-use SQL queries for data validation.

## Stopping

```bash
cd orchestration && docker-compose down
cd ../streaming && docker-compose down
cd ../processing && docker-compose down
```
